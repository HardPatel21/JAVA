ðŸ’° Problem Statement 2: Advanced Banking System with Account Types

Title: Model a Banking System with Account Inheritance Using super

Objective:
Create a banking system with different account types. Begin with a base class Account and extend it for different account types.

ðŸ”¹ Class Account (Base Class)

* Fields: accountNumber, holderName, balance
* Constructor to initialize these fields
* Method deposit(amount)
* Method withdraw(amount) â€“ checks for sufficient balance
* Method display() â€“ prints account info

ðŸ”¹ Class SavingsAccount (Extends Account)

* Additional field: interestRate
* Overrides withdraw(amount) to:

  * Call super.withdraw() for base checks
  * Then log: "Savings withdrawal processed with interest rate: [interestRate]%"

ðŸ”¹ Class CurrentAccount (Extends Account)

* Additional field: overdraftLimit
* Overrides withdraw(amount) to:

  * Allow withdrawals even beyond balance (up to overdraftLimit)
  * Call super.withdraw() but enhance it with logic
  * If overdrawn, print: "Overdraft in use. Remaining limit: [remainingOverdraft]"

ðŸ”¹ Class PremiumAccount (Extends SavingsAccount)

* Adds a reward system: rewardPoints
* Overrides deposit():

  * Call super.deposit() then add reward points
* Overrides display() to include reward points

Requirements:

* Use super to:

  * Call parent constructors and methods
  * Extend and combine behaviors in overridden methods
* Create a transaction simulator that uses polymorphism to handle all account types and logs the results

Goal:
Demonstrate how super supports complex financial logic by building on shared behavior while customizing operations in eachÂ accountÂ type.
